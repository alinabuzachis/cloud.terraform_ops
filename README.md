### Testing and Development

The project uses `ansible-lint` and `black`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/cloud/terraform_ops/`, run:

```shell
  tox -e linters -vv
```

Sanity and unit tests are run as normal:

```shell
  ansible-test sanity
```

If you want to run AWS cloud integration tests, ensure you log in :

```shell
# using the "default" profile on AWS
  aws configure set aws_access_key_id     my-access-key
  aws configure set aws_secret_access_key my-secret-key
  aws configure set region                eu-north-1

```

Once credentials are set up, run all integration tests with `ansible-test integration` or run a subset of integration tests with `ansible-test integration <target>`.

This collection is tested using GitHub Actions. To know more about CI, refer to [CI.md](https://github.com/https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.terraform_ops/blob/stable-1/CI.md).
